The sum of the squares of the first 10 natural numbers is:
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 10 natural numbers and the square of the sum is:
3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 100 natural numbers and the square of the sum.
